3.  #### Summary
    I am 24 years old. I live in Minsk. 
    I have a technical secondary special education, currently I am a 5th-year student of the University. 
    I study in absentia at the faculty of international law and legal psychology.
    A result-oriented, meticulous novice web developer with non-commercial experience in creating various web 
    applications using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux**, and other technologies.
    I have been studying the above-mentioned technology stack since mid-2019. 
    I first got into web development when trying to connect third-party services for the client (CRM). 
    Since that time, I have been regularly engaged in self-education in the field. 
    I am not afraid of complex tasks, and the more I learn about how web applications work, 
    the more interest they arouse in me :) At the time of writing this portfolio, 
    I can independently create fullstack applications with a level of complexity - up to average, 
    using popular libraries that are often used in production.
    I know English at a low level and I'm already in the process of *fixing this bug* :)
